// Enigma Game Engine ===========
// By Noah Beauchamp
// Version 1 0 1
// Note:
// There is now a Editor, it is a work in progress and most of it 
// will probably change in the future. I'm going to pause work on the Editor
// to focus more on the Engine its self.
// 
// There is now a example application. its a very simple (and buggy) space simulation.
