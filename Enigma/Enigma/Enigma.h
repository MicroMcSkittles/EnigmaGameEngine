// Enigma Game Engine ===========
// By Noah Beauchamp
// Version 1 0 1
// Note:
// Rewrote like the entire thing. I didn't like how the engine and window were static. so I
// rewrote it. You can know make multiple windows and engine instances.
// Some of the functionality was lost, but I will add those features back in.
// 
// There is now a proof of consept editor. it isn't permanent
