Now, they send people here.
 They send people, uh, to work at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza.
 Great establishment. I mean, no, really, it's the best.
 They do it. They send people to work here in the animatronics.
 They. They walk around at night.
 And you see, they don't tell you that.
 Bonnie won't tell you that, but they do.
 They walk around the night, and not only do they do that, but they actually jump scare you.
 And this is what they do. You see it?
 They jump scare you.
 And it's actually disgraceful. It's. It's truly disgraceful. Seriously.
